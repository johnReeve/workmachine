#HOWDY!

This is a nodejs application that I was working with to:

1) try and learn nodejs
1) try and make it easier to work with other folks.

IIRC, it has a user login system, a paste-bin clone, and a simple chat application.  I had intended to add a todo /issue  tracker, but haven't had time.

It's based on the "Hackathon Starter" node project, so there is a whole lot of this and that in it already.

This code is:

- untested,
- has no liscense (but you can do whatever you want with it)
- has no warranty, gurantee of correctness, etc.
- is unsupported by me

That said, if you find it useful, use it.
