I. Install

    1. Configure the script files and save them as:

    /scripts/start.sh
    /scripts/upstart-work-machine

    2. setup the scripts to run in init.d

    sudo cp scripts/upstart-work-machine /etc/init.d/upstart-work-machine
    sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/upstart-work-machine

    3. After putting the script in place, you should update the system service definitions:

    sudo update-rc.d my-application defaults

    4. Check your work:

    service upstart-work-machine start
    service upstart-work-machine status
    service upstart-work-machine restart
    service upstart-work-machine stop

II. Deploy

        say a prayer

        >> service upstart-work-machine restart
