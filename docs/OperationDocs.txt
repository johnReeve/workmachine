work-machine.js
An application to help me do work (ostensibly).

I. Install Docs

II. Deploy Docs

-----=======------

I. Install

    We're doing this all by hand, but someday... deploy scripts :D

    Pull down the repo

    npm install --production

    Create installation specific files:

        /config/secrets.js
        /docs/InstallationSpecificDocs.txt

    Setup nginx to serve the app on the right port

    Damonize the app

        1. Configure the script files and save them as:

        /scripts/upstart-work-machine

        2. setup the scripts to run in init.d

        sudo cp scripts/upstart-work-machine /etc/init.d/upstart-work-machine.conf
        
        4. Check your work:

        service upstart-work-machine start
        service upstart-work-machine status
        service upstart-work-machine restart
        service upstart-work-machine stop

    Test to see if the site is up... then create a user on the front end, and give them admin status in the mongocli:

        db.users.update({}, {$set: {roles: ['admin']}})
    
    Also create a db admin user, maybe
        db.addUser( { user: "wm_admin", pwd: "11databaser;;", roles: [ "userAdminAnyDatabase" ] } )

    Setup Database Backup
        wsMongoBackup cron

II. Deploy

    To update the software:

        >> git pull origin master

        update any additional config/secret.js settings

        >> npm install --production 

        light a candle, spin the prayer wheels

        >> sudo service upstart-work-machine restart

    No Database migration at this time.
